### About Niantic Studio

Niantic Studio is two things - a new visual editor Niantic 8th Wall and a powerful new web gaming 
engine. It moves 8th Wall from a code-heavy website building tool to a true visual editing experience 
that makes everything you create accessible and visible in real time. Niantic Studio offers progressive 
complexity that enables you to build immersive experiences easily and quickly, while continuing to offer 
the professional-quality tools, code, and customization that you expect from 8th Wall.
